## Youtube video installer and splitter

- The software allows you to input YouTube URLs and downloads the videos as .mp4 files. It then automatically splits these files into 60MB segments, which is ideal for sharing on WhatsApp and other similar messaging platforms. This makes it possible to quickly download and share videos of any length within minutes.
